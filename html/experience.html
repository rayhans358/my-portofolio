              <br />
              Analyzed plans for installing insert transformers on the Medium
              Voltage Network. Inserting transformers is carried out to maintain
              the performance of the transformer so that there is no voltage
              drop in the transformer. Transformer insertion is usually done by
              replacing the transformer and increasing the voltage so that the
              voltage requirements are met.
